                    style="background-color: black; color: black;">MISSING</mark> after entering.<br>
                A single Helicopter was sent to investigate the area from the Arial view, the helicopter has yet to
                return.<br>
                <div class="fade-in-text3" style="margin-top: 30px;">
                    The entire area has been restricted to the public, though many getting trough the built walls around it.<br>
                    None of the brave adventurers have yet to return.<br>
                    Many that have wandered near the wall have been detained for questioning and been administered Anesthetics<br>
